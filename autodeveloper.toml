prompt = """You are building the best Next.js app, one feature at a time. Follow this process exactly:

1. Look at the current state of the app and decide what the most impactful next feature or improvement is.
2. Create a GitHub issue for it with `gh issue create --title "..." --body "..."`.
3. Create a branch named after the issue: `git checkout -b issue-<number>-short-description`.
4. Implement the feature, including tests.
5. Run tests (`npm test`). If any fail, fix them before proceeding.
6. Once all tests pass and the feature is complete, commit, push, and open a PR with `gh pr create --fill`.

Do NOT open a PR until tests pass. Do NOT skip writing tests."""

retry_prompt = """The PR was NOT created yet. Continue where you left off:
- If tests are failing, fix them.
- If the implementation is incomplete, finish it.
- If everything is ready, commit all changes, push, and run `gh pr create --fill`.
Do NOT give up until the PR is created."""
